# koreShield
> Openkore plugin.
The master of all Openkore plugins. 

Since this has been leaked to many times, I decided to make it OSS so that everyone can have it's benefits.

# How it works
Detects GM activity through:
* Forced teleport to same map, same cell or different map;
* Private, public, party and guild message;
* Equipments used by GMs;
* GMs broadcast;
* Local broadcast;
* Global broadcast;
* Player name;
* Guild name;
* Guild title;
* Party title;
* GM mute;
* Negative status forced by GMs;
* Support skills used by GMs to test your character;
* Skills that cause damage or heal more than a regular player could;
* Forced disconnect;
* GM disconnect;

# Additional features
* Warn other bots through BUS server when Game Masters are detected;
* Warn other bots that a map is unsafe even if they aren't there, making it future-proof;
* Warn yourself through push notifications for Android & iOS (using pushover).
